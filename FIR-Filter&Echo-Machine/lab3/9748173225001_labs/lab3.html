</ul>
<p>In this lab you will design two simple DSP systems: FIR filter and echo machine. You will use Matlab to determine coefficients for your FIR filter. You will then describe the FIR filter and the echo machine in Verilog and implement them in an FPGA on the DE2 development board. You will use the FIR filter to filter out noise from a sample waveform file. You will also explore the parameters of the echo machine and observe how they affect the output.</p>
<p>As part of this lab, you will use the audio codec chip on the DE2 board, to demonstrate the use of digital signal processing systems. You will also use Matlab to determine coefficients for the FIR filter that you will build in the lab.</p>
<p>The DE2 board contains an audio codec chip, which contains A/D and D/A converters. An analog audio signal from line-in or microphone inputs on the DE2 board can be converted to digital form using the A/D converter, and brought to the FPGA for processing. The processed digital signal can then be sent from the FPGA to the codec to be converted to analog signal using the D/A converter and sent to the line-out output of the board. You will be provided with an interface to the codec chip and will be required to read the digital data the chip presents to you, process it using an appropriate circuit, and send it back to the codec chip.</p>
<dl class="description"><dt class="dt-description"><b>System Description:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">The system you are building is shown in Figure <a href="#lab4f11">1 System Block Diagramfigure.</a>. You are provided with a Quartus II starter project which already contains the interface to the codec and an empty module that serves as a placeholder for your design. Top-level system is described in <i>system.v</i>Verilog file. You should NOT modify this file. System&rsquo;s components are described in the following sections.

</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>Interface to the Codec:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">A simple interface to the audio codec chip on the DE2 board is provided for you, so that you do not have to deal with low-level details of the chip configuration and data handling. The interface sets the configuration of the codec chip as follows:
<ul class="itemize">
<li class="li-itemize">Sampling frequency: 8kHz</li>
<li class="li-itemize">Sample data-width: 16 bit, signed (2&rsquo;s complement) numbers</li>
</ul>
The interface also selects an input source and controls volume of the output. The volume can be adjusted using the push-button KEY[0]. Pressing this button increases the counter that controls the volume. Once the counter reaches its maximum value it overflows and the volume drops to 0. The system can be reset using the switch SW[3]. Resetting the system sets the volume to the default (low) value. Input source can be selected between line-in and microphone. This selection is controlled by SW[2]. When SW[2] is in the off (0) position, line-in is selected, otherwise the microphone is selected.
<p>The interface presents samples as 16-bit signed numbers. A new sample is available on every positive edge of the signal <i>sample_clock</i>. Your circuit (DSP subsystem) should process the sample and send it to the output on the next positive edge of <i>sample_clock</i> for the FIR filter, or a number of clock cycles later for the echo machine. In either case, you should send one sample per clock cycle to the output.</p>
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>DSP Subsystem:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">DSP subsystem is contained in the <i>dsp_subsystem.v</i>Verilog file. You should instantiate all sub-modules you need inside of this module. You are free (and encouraged) to create new Verilog files to describe parts of your system.
<p>When you open <i>dsp_subsystem.v</i> you will notice that the output is directly connected to the input, which means that samples are simply forwarded to the output, without any processing. If you compile this project and download it to the DE2 board, you should be able to hear yourself when microphone is selected, and hear whatever is on the line-in input when line-in is selected by switch SW[2]. To complete the lab, you are required to implement an FIR filter and an echo machine. You will also create a multiplexer which will allow you to select what data gets sent to the output, as shown in Figure 2.</p>

<p>Multiplexer can select between the original (unprocessed) signal, output of the FIR filter, or output of the echo machine. The select lines will be connected to the switches SW[1] and SW[0] of the DE2 board, so that you can control which signal is selected. Using a multiplexer in this fashion will help in debugging your circuit. For instance, if you can hear the sound coming from the FIR filter, but not the sound from the echo machine, that means you only need to fix the echo machine. On the other hand, if no sound can be heard regardless of the selected source, the problem might be in incorrectly plugged headphones or microphone, or too low volume setting.</p>
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>FIR Filter:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">In this part of the lab you will design an FIR filter that eliminates noise of a specific frequency. This will be the same filter whose coefficients you determined in the tutorial using Matlab. As discussed in the lectures, FIR filter consists of a number of registers, multipliers and adders. To make the design reusable, you will create a parameterizable FIR filter whose number of taps can be changed. To do this, you will require many wires to interconnect the modules. For example, each register outputs a 16-bit number. Therefore, if we have say 4 registers, there are 4 sets of 16-bit buses that need to be handled. To deal with this, you can declare an array of buses, as illustrated in the following code sample:
<div class="lstlisting">module buses_2_d (input [7:0] a, input [7:0] b, input [1:0] sel,<br />output reg [7:0] result);<br />// PAY ATTENTION: THE NEXT LINE IS COUNTERINTUITIVE, BUT CORRECT!<br />wire [7:0] bus_2_d [3:0]; // declares four 8-bit buses<br /><br />assign bus_2_d[0] = a+b;<br />// the first 8-bit bus connects to the output of a+b<br />assign bus_2_d[1] = a-b;<br />// the second 8-bit bus connects to the output of a-b<br />assign bus_2_d[2] = b-a;<br />// the third 8-bit bus connects to the output of b-a<br />assign bus_2_d[3] = a*b;<br />// the fourth 8-bit bus connects to the output of a*b<br />// The following always block implements a multiplexer that selects<br />// among the four results<br />always @(*)<br />begin<br /> case (sel)<br /> 2'b00: result = bus_2_d[0];<br /> 2'b01: result = bus_2_d[1];<br /> 2'b10: result = bus_2_d[2];<br /> 2'b11: result = bus_2_d[3];<br /> endcase<br />end<br />endmodule</div>
The above code implements the circuit shown in Figure <a href="#lab4f13">3 Circuits Produced by Verilog Codefigure</a>.<br />

<p>Please note that the above code is just an illustration of how arrays of buses are declared and used. It does not otherwise reflect the FIR filter you should design.</p>
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>Registers:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">Registers can be built using behavioral description, as discussed in class. To create a number of registers that can be parameterizable, you can either use for loops, or create a separate module that describes a register, and then use a generate statement to create an appropriate number of instances of the register</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>Multipliers:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">To implement a multiplier, you will have to use one of the library components provided as a part of Quartus II Library of Parameterizable Modules (LPMs). LPM provides a way to implement many common digital circuit elements without having to specify their functionality. In addition, these modules are usually optimized for efficient implementation in FPGAs. To create a multiplier, follow these steps:<ol class="enumerate" type="1">
<li class="li-enumerate">Select Tools MegaWizard Plug-In Manager</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">A window will pop-up, with the text &ldquo;Create a new custom megafunction variation". Leave that text selected and click Next.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">In the next window on the left side you will find a list of different types of library modules. Click on the + sign next to the &ldquo;Arithmetic" category, and then select LPM_MULT. Under &ldquo;Which type of output do you want to create?" select &ldquo;Verilog HDL". Under &ldquo;What name do you want for the output file?" select <i>multiplier.v</i>. (Note that the <i>multiplier.v</i> file name is arbitrary, and you could use a different name). Click Next.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">Select widths of &lsquo;dataa&rsquo; and &lsquo;datab&rsquo; inputs to be 16 bits, because you will be multiplying two 16-bit numbers. Leave other options at their default values. Click Next.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">Under &ldquo;Does the &lsquo;datab&rsquo; input bus have a constant value?" leave the setting as &ldquo;No" (Although our multipliers will be used to multiply with a constant, you would have to specify each constant through this interface, which is not practical). Under &ldquo;Which type of multiplication do you want?" select &ldquo;Signed". Leave other options at their default values. Click Next.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">On the next two pages leave all options at their default values. Click Next twice, then click Finish.</li>
<li class="li-enumerate">The multiplier module is created for you. To see it, you can open the newly created file <i>multiplier.v</i>. You should see a module called <i>multiplier</i>, which you can use (i.e. instantiate) like any other module. You should not change anything in the <i>multiplier.v</i> file. You should simply use the newly created module in your code where needed.<br /> You might be wondering why you cannot use the &ldquo;*" Verilog operator to implement multiplication. The answer is that the &ldquo;*" operator implements unsigned multiplication, whereas we need signed multiplication, because our samples and coefficients can be negative.</li>
</ol></dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>Adders:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">You can create an adder by using the Verilog &ldquo;+" operator. Unlike multiplication, addition is the same whether the input numbers are signed or unsigned, so the &ldquo;+" operator is sufficient.</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>Coefficients:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">To fully specify the FIR filter, all of its coefficients have to be specified. One simple way to declare all coefficients is to declare an array of buses and assign constant coefficients to them. This can be done either using an assign statement, or using an always block, in which case the array of buses has to be declared as <i>reg</i>type. The following example illustrates how one might specify four 8-bit coefficients:
<div class="lstlisting">reg [7:0]coeffs[3:0];<br />always @(*)<br />begin<br />coeffs[0]= 7;<br />coeffs[1]= -6;<br />coeffs[2]= 17;<br />coeffs[3]= 0;<br />end</div>
<p>Note that the numbers are specified as signed decimal numbers. Quartus will interpret them correctly and convert them into 2&rsquo;s complement binary numbers. However, you will get warning messages about truncated bits, because the plain numbers like this are considered to be 32 bits wide. You can safely ignore these messages, at least for these numbers.</p>
<p>You will obtain correct values for coefficients from Matlab. Remember that you have to convert the coefficients into integers, and compensate for that after the multiplication, as discussed in class.</p>
</dd><dt class="dt-description"><b>Echo Machine:</b></dt><dd class="dd-description">In this part of the lab you will design a simple echo machine. The basic idea is to delay the samples of an audio signal and then add them to the current samples, as shown in Figure (4a). In this design, only the original signal is stored in the delay line. Therefore, such a circuit would only achieve echo with constant delay. A better idea is to store the signal with echo into the delay line, which produces multiple echoes. This circuit is shown in Figure (4b). The problem with this design is that the samples get constantly added to existing ones, which eventually results in noise. To prevent that, the delayed component of the signal is divided by a constant factor, which produces a nice decaying echo of the input. This design is shown in Figure (4c).

<p>Although division operation implemented in hardware can be quite expensive, recall that division by a number that is a power of 2 translates into a simple shift operation, so you should choose a division factor that is a power of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16,...), and implement it using a shift operation. Do not forget that samples are signed numbers.</p>
<p>To implement the delay, you could use a series of registers connected to one another. This configuration is known as shift-register. One problem with this approach is that it requires excessive amount of registers to implement an audible delay (you will calculate just how many registers are required as a part of your lab report). Since the FPGA you are using contains only 1 register per logic block, such an implementation could potentially use up all the resources on the FPGA. Therefore, an alternative has to be found. The FPGA you are using also contains memory blocks, which can be used to store samples. Quartus II LPM library contains a component that can implement a shift register using memory blocks. To find it, start the MegaWizard Plug-In Manager (<i>Tools</i>&rarr; <i>MegaWizard</i> <i>Plug</i>&minus;<i>In</i> <i>Manager</i>) and under category &ldquo;Memory Compiler", select &ldquo;Shift Register (RAM-based)". Specify a name for the module to be generated (e.g <i>shiftregister.v</i>) and specify that you wish to generate Verilog HDL output. On the next page select both input and output data widths to be 16 bits.</p>
<p>The length of the shift register is specified in a rather peculiar way. There are two parameters offered to you: number of taps, and distance between the taps. The length of the shift register (i.e. the number of samples that will be stored in it) will be equal to the product of these two numbers. For example, the default values in those two fields are 32 and 8, which means that the shift register would contain 32*8 = 256 registers, and could therefore store 256 samples. It also means that it would take 256 clock cycles for the input to propagate to the output. Therefore, the delay that this shift register introduces would be 256 clock cycles. You should select these two numbers in such a way that they provide the delay you wish to achieve.</p>
<p>Once you have created the memory-based shift register, open its Verilog file to see the module declaration. If you used the suggested name, the file you are looking for is <i>shiftregister.v</i>. You should not change anything in this file. You can now instantiate the shift-register module in your module that implements the echo machine. You will notice that the produced shift register module has an output called taps. We will not use this output, and you can safely omit it when you create an instance of this module (i.e. when creating an instance, simply do not include this port in the port list).</p>
<p>Once you have the shift register, you just need to connect it appropriately to the divider and adder. Don&rsquo;t forget to implement the divider using a simple shift operation. The adder can be implemented using the &ldquo;+" Verilog operator.</p>
